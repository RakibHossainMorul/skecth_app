I will ensure that the app features a canvas area where users can draw with their fingers, supporting multiple stroke colors and widths while maintaining responsiveness across various screen sizes. Additionally, I will implement stroke width selection, undo/redo functionality, and a button to clear the canvas for a new drawing. Furthermore, I will incorporate a feature to download the drawing as an image file and utilize state management to efficiently manage the canvas state, color selection, and stroke width. For file handling, I will implement saving the drawing to the device's storage while adhering to proper permissions. Responsive design will be a priority to ensure a consistent user experience across different devices. Lastly, I will focus on maintaining high code quality by organizing the code effectively, providing thorough comments, and adhering to Dart and Flutter best practices. I will also include error handling and validation where necessary to enhance the overall reliability of the application.
